# Create the cumulative probability matrix, and try to add into a function
# the upper.tri, lower.tri, and diag in case_when to determine the outcome. However
# I am getting a little confused, and need to understand how to properly understand
# what I want inside of the function, and what arguments the function would need to take.

# Clean up the code
# Send email by Tuesday to be looked at by wednesday
# rerun with 10 goals
# change matrix size
# use row and column names to track certain results throughout the function

# Fixed prediction formula, got rid of NA's, and iterated 1000 times for the first match.

# What I am trying to do is to iterate over many matches. What I was thinking was doing a for loop
# but where I get stuck is trying to iterate over two variables (proj_score1 and proj_score2) 1000 times.
