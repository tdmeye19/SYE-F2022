# SYE-F2022
Repository for my Senior Year Experience at St. Lawrence University.

My SYE has two parts:
1. I finished analyzing what started as an independent study under the guidance of Dr. Karin Heckman, and then turned into a Summer Fellowship at St. Lawrence University in 2022 working with Dr. Matt Higham.

2. I attempted to recreate some probabilities that teams would make it out of the group stages of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups using FiveThirtyEight's data and an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-2018-world-cup-predictions-work/) partially explaining how they come up with their predictions.
