# SYE-F2022
Repository for my Senior Year Experience at St. Lawrence University.

My SYE has two parts:
1. I finished analyzing what started as an independent study under the guidance of Dr. Karin Heckman, and then turned into a Summer Fellowship at St. Lawrence University in 2022 working with Dr. Matt Higham.

2. I attempted to recreate some probabilities that teams would make it out of the group stages of the World Cup using FiveThirtyEight's data.
